Ok, so.

A Modern Compiler Implementation in ML uses SML/NJ.
As of 11/21, my primary dev environment is an m1 macbook, but SML/NJ doesn't
properly work on m1 devices.
As such, I've decided to use OCaml!

Luckily, OCaml and SML/NJ are... related.
Not drop-in replacements, and there will *probably* be some things I'll have to
change, but I suspect it's possible and might not be too hard.
